h1. (Some of) the Flickr API in jQuery.

Sometimes all you need is a simple javascript interface to pull in Flickr photos.

h2. Why?

Because I _love_ javascript. Also, because I had to solve this problem recently, and the current solutions were 
too "not my style". Most had a universal @flickr()@ method that required the user to pass a string of the method 
to be executed. I'd rather just _call_ a method than explain what method to call. Which brings me into my next point...

h2. Chaining

Something common to jQuery users is the ability to chain method calls. Well, I took that a step further when
designing out the plugin interface. Initially, the user calls @flickr()@ on the jQuery object, which then makes all
of the supported Flickr API calls available, allowing the user to "chain" the API call directly to the @flickr()@ object. 
And the beauty is that the result of the API call will then return the original jQuery object, so you can continue 
chaining on your merry way :-)

An example speaks a thousand words, I know...

<pre><code>$('#photos').flickr({api_key: 'xxx'}).getRecentPhotos({per_page: 2}).addClass('thumbnails')

// returns something like ...

<div id="photos" class="thumbnails">
  <ul class="flickr">
    <li>
      <a title="<image title>" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/<user_id>/<photo_id>/">
        <img alt="<image title>" src="<square thumbnail url>"/>
      </a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a title="<image title>" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/<user_id>/<photo_id>/">
        <img alt="<image title>" src="<square thumbnail url>"/>
      </a>
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>
</code></pre>

You can see how calling @addClass()@ at the very end was pretty much the same as calling @$('#photos').addClass()@ directly.
Again, the chained Flickr API call returns the original jQuery object.

Note: you can turn off image linking by passing @{link_images: false}@ to the @flickr()@ method.

Also, any configuration you pass to the first call (i.e. @flickr()@) will get merged with the rest of the calls and appended
to the request url. So things like the API key (which is required on _every_ request) becomes a little less redundant.

h2. Examples

<pre><code>// common configuration
var config = {
  api_key: 'xxx'
}

// recent public photos
$('#photos').flickr(config).photosGetRecent()

// recent 8 photos from a user's contacts
$('#photos').flickr(config).photosGetContactsPublicPhotos({user_id: 'xxx', count: 8})

// recent 10 photos from a user's stream
$('#photos').flickr(config).photosSearch({user_id: 'xxx', count: 10})

// recent 10 photos from a user's stream with the tag 'portfolio'
$('#photos').flickr(config).photosSearch({user_id: 'xxx', count: 10, tags: 'portfolio'})
</code></pre>

You get the idea. All of the options listed on the "Flickr API":http://flickr.com/services/api (for the supported methods)
are available. The @photosSearch()@ method is by far the most useful - perfect for showing your photos on your blog or site.
